# Mongo-TS

### About :
Using decorators located in key positions in a class (represent your mongoose schema, only definitely typed), a 'native' mongoose schema is being build behind the scene, without you repetitively write your schema (once as an interface, class and then a mongoose schema) 

**Using mongo-ts your schema need to be written once as a class - and a typed cover schema will be created for you.**
